# SpaceTravel coding challenge
This project is my solution to a small coding challenge. 
Problem domain is traveling between star systems in space.

The first five exercises specifies routes between stars and want the distance.
All other exercises have different problems.

## Project structure
This solution contains four class implementations.
StarSystem and SpaceHighway is an implementation for building graphs. 
The first
